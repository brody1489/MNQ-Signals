PASTE YOUR DISCLAIMER HERE
==========================

The disclaimer page loads from this folder. No Google Docs — your words live here.

Open content/disclaimer.html and paste your full disclaimer (word for word).
You can use HTML: <p>, <h2>, <ul>, <li>, <a> etc.

Run the site with:  npx serve -l 3000
(from the the-trading-circle-site folder). Then open http://localhost:3000
