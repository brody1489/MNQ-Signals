# Think BIG — Platform, $200–$2000/mo, Things People Run Their Business On

You're right: $20/mo gets you hobbyists and support headaches. **Big** means: the thing that runs their operation. They can't work without it. They pay **$200–500/mo** (SMB) or **$500–2000/mo** (growing companies) because it's the **system** — customers, jobs, employees, routing, billing, invoices, the works. Or: the **terminal** — data + workflow + tools in one place for a whole profession.

Below are **three big directions**. Each is a **platform** you can grow into; you don't build every module day one, but the **vision** is "this is the thing they run their business on."

---

## 1. Full field service / trade business platform (what you described)

**The big product**  
One system that does **everything** for a trade company (plumbing, HVAC, electrical, landscaping, restoration, etc.):

- **Customers**: who they are, address, contact, history, what they want (notes, preferences).
- **Jobs**: create job, attach customer, address, what to do, priority, due date.
- **Scheduling & routing**: assign jobs to techs/crews, optimize routes, drag-and-drop board, drag to reschedule.
- **Employee tracking**: who's where, clock in/out per job, GPS (optional), status (en route, on site, done).
- **Mobile for techs**: see today's route, job details, "what to do," check off tasks, add notes/photos, mark done.
- **Billing**: labor + parts + trip charges, markups, tax. Auto-generate invoice from completed job.
- **Invoicing**: create/send invoice, track paid/unpaid, statements, optionally auto-charge.
- **Printing**: invoices, work orders, route sheets — PDF or thermal if they use handheld printers.
- **Reports**: revenue by period, by tech, by job type; outstanding AR; job completion rate.

That's the **full** vision. Not a "job list app" — the **operating system** for that business. Price: **$200–500/mo** for small shops (5–15 techs), **$500–1500/mo** for 15–50, **$1500–3000+/mo** for bigger. Per-seat or tiered by trucks/techs.

**Why it's big**  
ServiceTitan and Jobber exist, but: (1) ServiceTitan is **enterprise** and heavy; (2) Jobber is SMB but generic; (3) **60% of contractors abandon FSM within 6 months** because it doesn't fit how they work. There's room for a platform **built for one vertical** that feels like "our" system — e.g. **restoration** (water/fire/mold), **landscaping**, or **pool service**. Each has specific workflows (insurance, Xactimate, seasonal contracts, chemical logs) that generic FSM does poorly.

**How you'd get there (without a 50-person team)**  
You don't ship "everything" v1. You ship the **core loop** that makes them sticky, then add modules:

- **Phase 1**: Customers + jobs + scheduling (calendar/board) + **mobile job view** for techs (today's list, job details, mark done). No billing yet — they can still invoice elsewhere. Goal: they run **dispatch and field** in your product every day. **$150–250/mo** for this alone is possible if it's good.
- **Phase 2**: Billing + invoices (generate from job, send, track). Now they don't leave for QuickBooks for invoicing.
- **Phase 3**: Routing, employee tracking, reports, printing, integrations (QuickBooks, Stripe).

Pick **one vertical** (e.g. restoration or landscaping) and sell only to that at first. You become "the restoration platform" or "the landscaping platform," not "another FSM." That's how you get **$200–500/mo** and clients who care: they're buying the system that runs their business.

**Why $200–2000/mo, not $20**  
Because you're replacing: dispatching (often a full-time person), paper/Excel, and 2–3 other tools. The value is **tens of thousands a year** in saved time and fewer missed jobs. They'll pay **$200–500/mo** when it's the spine of the company.

## 2. "Terminal" for a vertical — data + workflow + tools in one place

**The big product**  
Like a **Bloomberg terminal** but for a **specific** industry: one place where pros get **data**, **workflow**, and **tools** they use every day. Not "a feature" — the **daily workspace**.

Examples:

- **Commercial real estate (small shops)**  
  Deal pipeline, contacts, comps, debt/product data, documents, deadlines — one login. Dealpath/Northspyre are enterprise. There's room for "the platform for 1–20 person CRE shops" at **$200–500/mo** — deal tracking, simple comps, contact/deal notes, doc storage, and eventually more data (e.g. ownership, loans).

- **Physical commodities / ag / logistics**  
  Bids, contracts, shipments, market data, counterparties — still very fragmented (email, spreadsheets, legacy systems). A **unified workspace** for a niche (e.g. grain, or regional trucking) could command **$200–1000/mo** if it becomes "where we do our job."

- **Trading (your world)**  
  Not "another broker" — the **pro workspace**: data (real-time or delayed), charts, journal, risk (position, P&L), execution (via broker API), alerts, maybe simple backtesting. One place. **$200–500/mo** for serious retail/semi-pros who'd rather pay for "the system" than stitch 5 tools together. The moat is **integration + workflow**, not data alone.

**Why it's big**  
People pay **$2000+/mo** for Bloomberg because it's **everything**. In smaller verticals, no one has built "everything" yet — so you build the **first** "terminal" for that world. Price scales with value: **$200–500/mo** for SMB, **$500–2000/mo** for teams.

**How you'd get there**  
Start with **one workflow** that's painful today: e.g. "deal pipeline + contacts + docs" for CRE, or "positions + P&L + journal" for traders. Ship that as the **core**. Then add data (feeds, comps, etc.) and more tools. The **vision** from day one: "this is the place they open every morning."

**Why $200–2000/mo**  
Because you're replacing multiple subscriptions + spreadsheets + mental overhead. When it's **the** workspace, they'll pay platform money.

## 3. Vertical "run your whole business" — one industry, full stack

**The big product**  
Same idea as (1) but **industry-specific** from the start: not "FSM for anyone," but **"the platform for [restoration / landscaping / pool service / etc.]."** Every feature is built for that vertical's workflow, so it feels like **their** system.

**Restoration (water, fire, mold)**  
Insurance-driven: job comes in → scope (often Xactimate) → drying logs → documentation → billing insurance + customer. Your platform: **customers/jobs + scheduling + techs in the field + drying logs + docs + invoicing (insurance + customer)**. Integrate or partner with Xactimate/estimating. **$300–800/mo** per company — they're used to paying for software that gets them paid by carriers.

**Landscaping**  
Properties (not just "customers" — same property, recurring), seasonal contracts, crews, routes, mowing/fertilizing/design work, billing (recurring + one-off). **$200–600/mo** for companies that run 5–30 properties or more.

**Pool service**  
Recurring routes, chemical logs per site, equipment per site, recurring billing. Very route-centric. **$200–500/mo.**

**Why it's big**  
Generic FSM does "job + schedule + invoice." Vertical platforms do **"our" workflow**: insurance docs, drying logs, property history, chemical readings, seasonal contracts. That's **$200–800/mo** because it's the **business in a box**.

**How you'd get there**  
Pick **one** vertical. Talk to 10–20 companies: what do you use today? What's broken? Build the **minimum** that gets them to run their **core** day in your product (e.g. jobs + schedule + field for restoration). Charge **$200–300/mo** from the start. Add billing, then vertical-specific features (drying logs, chemical logs, etc.). Scale by going deep in that industry first; expand to adjacent later.

## Summary: think BIG

| Direction | What it is | Price range | How you start |
|-----------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Full FSM platform** | Customers, jobs, scheduling, routing, tech app, billing, invoices, tracking, reports — the whole operation | $200–500/mo (small) → $500–2000/mo (growing) | Core: customers + jobs + schedule + mobile "today's jobs." One vertical first. Add billing, then routing, then rest. |
| **"Terminal" for a vertical** | Data + workflow + tools in one place (CRE, commodities, or trading) | $200–500/mo (SMB) → $500–2000/mo (teams) | One painful workflow first (e.g. deal pipeline, or positions + journal). Then add data and more tools. |
| **Vertical "run your business"** | Full stack for one industry (restoration, landscaping, pool) — their workflows, not generic | $200–800/mo | One vertical. Core loop (jobs + schedule + field) at $200–300/mo. Add vertical-specific features and billing. |

All three are **platforms** people run their business on. **$200/mo** is the floor; **$500–2000/mo** is where you aim as you add value. Clients are **businesses**, not hobbyists — they need the system, they pay for it, and they stay.

If you pick one direction (FSM, terminal, or vertical), we can break it into **v1 scope** (what to build first so it's already "big" enough to charge $200+/mo) and how to get the first 5–10 paying customers.
